## Multiple User Inputs Example

This repository contains two code examples written in C: `lesson2_largestNumber.c` and `lesson1_userInput.c`, which demonstrate different aspects of user input handling.

### `lesson2_largestNumber.c`

This code demonstrates how to receive multiple user inputs with a single line of code using the `get_int` function. It includes the function `get_int` that allows the user to input an integer value with a prompt. The `main` function showcases the usage of the `get_int` function by receiving three integer inputs: `x`, `y`, and `z`. Each input is obtained with a prompt and then printed on the console. The code also determines the largest number among the inputs and displays it.

### `lesson1_userInput.c`

This code focuses on receiving and processing user inputs using `if-else` statements. It includes the `get_int` function for receiving an integer input from the user with a prompt. The `main` function demonstrates the use of `if-else` statements to handle different user inputs and perform conditional operations based on the input values. By following the prompts, the user can enter values for `x`, `y`, and `z`, and the code determines the largest number among the inputs and displays it.

## Usage

To use these code examples, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the source code files.
2. Compile the desired code file using a C compiler.
3. Run the compiled executable.
4. Follow the prompts to enter integer values for the corresponding variables.
5. The entered values and the output of the code will be displayed on the console.

Feel free to modify and adapt the code according to your needs.
